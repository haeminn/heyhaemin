Before this tool was built, the QA process involved the following extensive steps:</p><ol class="browser-default"><li>Going on survey taking environment and choosing a survey to QA</li><li>Choosing an answer to every question on the survey</li><li>Submitting the survey and waiting for the survey result to calculate</li><li>Going on the dashboard enviornment to check the survey outcome</li></ol><p>My goal was to make this process happen all in one environment without the hassle of keeping tabs on multiple products. And with this tool, the QA process has improved with the following:</p><ul class="browser-default"><li>Logging in as a valid user to access all clients and surveys</li><li>Giving a drop down list of all surveys available to QA</li><li>Generating survey result from cutomized or randomized inputs</li></ul><h6>AngularJS | Pug | SCSS</h6></div></div><div class="modal" id="modal3"><i class="material-icons right modal-action modal-close" href="#!">clear</i><div class="modal-content"><h5>CMS</h5><p>One of the first projects I did working as a software engineer was supporting the implementation and design of this CMS.</p><p>The app was built on AngularJS, and I worked on dynamic templating and routing.

Among these issues, some often have difficulty shifting their attention to perform daily activities.</p><p>PatternPal aims to help kids with autism gain more independence and offers time flexibility for their caretakers. Switching tasks is one of the main issues and so my team decided to address this issue in our app, PatternPal. </p><p>I received first hand user testing experience, and was able to see clearly how feedback translates into UI and UX. Finding willing volunteers within the market segment we were trying to serve posed a great challenge. However, we overcame this by branching out to families with young children, who provided us with valuable information.</p><p>It was satisfying working on an app for individuals who are underserved in this field.</p><h6>Swift(iOS)</h6></div></div>
